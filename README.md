# Tech Exercises

A collection of exercises from various places, whether that be a book, a site, a course, or just my own experiments with a particular technology.

## Books

* [Head First Design Patterns](ISBN_9780596007126/)


## Learning Resources

### Resources Used

This is the list of training sites I am currently using.

* [https://www.linkedin.com/learning/](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/)
    * they have learning paths (and they're a filter/search option)
    * pricing is reasonable @ ~$20 per month
    * is Lynda.com, which is a resource I've used on and off for almost 15 years
* [https://www.coursera.org/](https://www.coursera.org/)
    * Currently performing a trial with their [free Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
    * some courses can be "audited" for free
    * if you want the piece of paper, you have to pay
* [https://www.codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com)
    * all text, no videos, making it easy to get spun up quickly on certain things
    * free and easy to use
    * geared toward total beginners - there isn't even a Docker course

### Other Resources

These are other noteworthy training sites I found.  I ultimately decided to not use any of them.

* [https://www.udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com)
    * Honorable mention - I have a few courses that I purchased when they were on sale, and they were great
    * Major con is that each course is purchased individually
    * No learning paths
* [https://ocw.mit.edu/](https://ocw.mit.edu/)
* [https://online.stanford.edu/](https://online.stanford.edu/)
* [https://www.pluralsight.com](https://www.pluralsight.com)
    * Honorable mention - courses seem great
    * Pricing isn't terrible
    * search functionality was broken (console error!)
* [https://acloudguru.com](https://acloudguru.com)
    * It isn't clear to me what the relationship is between acloudguru and linux academy - seems to be the same thing.  This is probably a great resource for cloud-focused development and training.
    * I am not looking for cloud-focused development and training right now
* [https://www.udacity.com](https://www.udacity.com)
    * Did not choose because it is quite expensive
* [https://www.khanacademy.org/](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
    * Khan Academy is great in theory, though I've never used it, but it doesn't have the level of programming and computer science content that I'm after
* [https://brilliant.org/](https://brilliant.org/)
    * Not enough programming stuff
* [https://www.edx.org/learn/java](https://www.edx.org/learn/java)
    * No learning paths
* [https://www.sololearn.com](https://www.sololearn.com)
    * No preview of course content
* [https://www.masterclass.com/](https://www.masterclass.com/)
    * Not enough programming stuff
